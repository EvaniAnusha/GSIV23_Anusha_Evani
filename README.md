This file provides the steps about how to run and test the code

# a. Accessing Code files & Instructions

Movies Web App React code resides here, path: Frontend/movies-web-app/src

After cloning from the repository, install the node modules with the command ### `npm install` and initialize git in your cloned setup with the command ### `git init`. You can run the application on http://localhost:3000, in development mode, using the command ### `npm start`

This application was created using Create React App. All the related instructions, regarding how to run and test the code are already given in the readme file present in the folder path, Frontend\movies-web-app\README.md

In this deployment, we can run the command to create a production build, using ### `npm run build` command.
The automated test cases are not included as of now.

# b. Elements that I have performed well

These are the few specs on which I have worked well, given the time limit, 1. Connect to API, retrieving, parsing and presenting the list of movies and the details of each movie. 2. Handling of async operation for list page, involving infinite scroll 3. Code Structuring - A very well defined set of code files, organized and can easily be understood by other developers, keeping resuabiliy, maintainability as priorities 4. State management using redux toolkit

# c. If I had more time

    1. I would definitely had improved the performance of the application to ensure a seamless user experience.
    2. I would have had included the automated tests using Jest, React Test Renderer
    3. I would have studied more documentation about TMDB APIs and would have built and presented more details in the app.
    4. I would have worked for a better version of UI. In my opinion, for any developer, delivering UI is crucial while ensuring working functionalities in the web applications.
    5. I would have had included toast messages for indicating any warnings/errors while using the application

# d. Feedback

    I had a great hands-on experience while developing this project, while working alongside with my current job responsibilities. My feedback is only to the opensource API platform, you could include a better open-source/ free to use public domain. With the given time limit, I couldn't fully explore TMDB documentation as I have never worked with it before. As a result, I had faced some difficulty while development. Thank you for providing this opportunity, looking forward to discussing more opportunities.
